# Web Design Class - Bootstrap Assignment #1

## Trimester 2 - Using the Bootstrap framework to design responsive, mobile-first websites

# Individual Project: Create a site with Responsive Web Design

- Build the site using [**CodeAnywhere**](https://codeanywhere.com/)

- In **CodeAnywhere** , in the root directory, create a Folder called **bootstrap** . In the **bootstrap** folder create these files ( `index.html` and `style.css` ). 

## Requirements

- You will need to link to the bootstrap CDN in the `<head>` portion of the .html file (think CSS)
- use of **container** or **container-fluid** tag
- use of **jumbotron** class
- use at least 4 `row` divs
- use a multi-column layout in a way that the page renders differntly for smaller and larger devices (e.g. by using `col-sm-6` and `col-md-4`)

## Bonus

Use of **spacer** div. Hint: [Bootstrap Spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/)
